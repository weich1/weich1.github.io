## Welcome to the Blood Bank Services Project Website

This is a weekly updated blog of the progression from idea to functionality of the Blood Bank Services Project!

### Discription of Project

The project is to serve as a standalone entity for a blood bank service where donor information is stored along with a running count of blood storage amounts. It will also serve as an ordering service for hospitals and various uses alike. It will implement MySQL for the database aspect of the services and utilize PHP for the operation between the user, GUI, and database.
